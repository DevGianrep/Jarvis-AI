    Class: IronManHelmet:
        Central class encapsulating all the helmet's functionality. 
        Everything related to the helmet’s behavior and state belongs here.

    Initialization:
        Set up the hardware interfaces and initialize variables for the helmet.
            Initialize displays (e.g., HUD screen)
            Initialize sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, cameras, microphones)
            Initialize communication modules (Wi-Fi, radio, Bluetooth)
            Initialize power system variables (battery level, power status)
            Initialize internal state (e.g., is helmet worn? system ready?)
            Set default modes (vision mode, communication mode)

    Core Functionalities:   
        power_on()
            Boot up all systems in correct order.
            Perform self-checks.
            Turn on HUD, sensors, and communication.
            Transition helmet status to active.

        power_off()
            Safely shut down all systems.
            Save any persistent state.
            Turn off displays and sensors.
            Enter low power or off state.

    check_battery_level()
        Read current battery voltage/percentage.
        Provide warnings if battery is low.
        Return battery status to other systems.

    recharge()
        Manage power input during charging.
        Show charging progress on HUD.
        Prevent overcharging.

    Voice Commands

    activate_voice_command()
        Start listening for voice input.
        Provide audio/visual cue that voice recognition is active.
        process_voice_command(command)
        Parse user commands.
        Map commands to helmet actions (e.g., “open targeting mode”, “call Jarvis”).
        Handle errors or unclear commands.

    deactivate_voice_command()
        Stop voice listening mode.
        Confirm exit to the user.

    Communication System

    connect_to_base()
        Establish a secure communication link to external AI or base.
        Handle authentication and encryption.
        send_message(msg)
        Send text/audio/video messages.
        Queue messages if connection is down.

    receive_message()
        Receive and parse incoming messages.
        Notify user of incoming comms via HUD/audio alert.

    Environmental Sensors

    scan_surroundings()
        Use cameras, lidar, radar to scan the environment.
        Detect obstacles, people, threats.

    detect_threats()
        Analyze sensor data for potential dangers.
        Classify objects as friend or foe.
        Trigger alerts on HUD if threats detected.

    provide_weather_update()
        Fetch and display local weather data.
        Alert user to hazardous conditions.

    Safety Features

    emergency_shutdown()
        Immediately disable all systems for safety.
            Prevent hardware damage.
            Notify user and external systems.

    auto_lock_helmet()
        Detect if helmet is on/off user’s head.
        Lock helmet controls when removed.

    activate_emergency_beacon()
        Send distress signal with location.
        Flash visual/audio beacon.

    Motion and Gesture Controls

    detect_head_movement()
        Track helmet orientation using gyroscope/accelerometer.
        Control HUD or camera view based on movement.

    process_gesture_input()
        Recognize predefined hand/head gestures.
        Map gestures to commands (e.g., swipe to change HUD mode).

    Utilities

    calibrate_sensors()
        Perform calibration routines for accuracy.
        Compensate for drift or environmental changes.

    update_firmware()
        Manage over-the-air or wired firmware updates.
        Ensure version compatibility.

    diagnostics_report()
        Generate detailed system health report.
        Include logs, error reports, sensor status.

    User Interface / Feedback

    show_visual_feedback(message)
        Display messages or alerts on HUD.
        Use icons, colors, animations for clarity.

    play_audio_alert(alert_type)
        Play different alert sounds based on severity/type.
        E.g., warning beep, confirmation chime.

    vibrate_alert(pattern)
        Provide haptic feedback with custom vibration patterns.
        Useful for silent alerts.
